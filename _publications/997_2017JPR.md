**Abstract**:
Apoptosis and senescence are two types of cell fates in response to chemotherapy. Besides canonical pathways that mediate cell fates, cancer cell metabolism has been revealed as a crucial factor affecting cell fate decisions and thus represents a new target for antitumor therapy. Therefore, a comprehensive description of metabolic pathways underlying cell senescence and apoptosis in response to chemotherapy is highly demanded for therapeutic exploitation of both processes. Herein we employed a metabolomics–proteomics combined approach to identify metabolism-associated molecular events that mediate cellular responses to senescence and apoptosis using doxorubicin-treated human breast cancer cells MCF7 as models. Such biomics approach revealed that tricarboxylic acid cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, and nucleotide synthesis pathways were significantly upregulated in the senescent model, whereas fatty acid synthesis was reduced. In apoptotic cells, an overall reduced activity of major metabolic pathways was observed except for the arginine and proline pathway. Combinatorially, these data show the utility of biomics in exploring biochemical mechanism-based differences between apoptosis and senescence and reveal an unprecedented finding of the metabolic events that were induced for survival by facilitating ROS elimination and DNA damage repair in senescent cells, while they were downregulated in apoptotic cells when DNA damage was irreparable.
