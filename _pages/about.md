Welcome to my personal website.

I am a PhD student in the School of Pharmacy at the UW-Madison and am so proud to be a member of [Li Lab](https://www.lilabs.org/). My primary research interest is the use of mass spectrometry to solve biological questions. #TeamMassSpec

When Iâ€™m not working, I enjoy traveling and swimming. Please feel free to reach out to me via email at gaoyuan.lu[at]protonmail.com.
